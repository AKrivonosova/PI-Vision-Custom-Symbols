Follow these simple instructions to install this custom symbol; the overall process should only take a minutes.

1. In Windows Explorer, navigate to the "PIPC\Coresight" installation folder on your PI Coresight server; typically, it's located in "C:\Program Files\PIPC\Coresight"

2. This is a symbol that uses the free Datatables javascript library; copy the Datatables.zip file and extract it into the "PIPC\Coresight" folder; there should now be a new folder named "Datatables" within PIPC\Coresight, and inside the "Datatables" folder you should see several sub-folders, .css, and .js files.

3. Next, from within the folder named "Coresight", navigate to the "\Scripts\app\editor\symbols" sub-folder.  

4. Within the folder named "symbols", if there is not already a folder called "ext", create a folder called "ext".  

5. Now that the "ext" folder exists, or already exits, open it, and paste into the "ext" folder the one .js, one .png, and two .html files in this custom symbol folder that you were sent.

The next time you open a web browser and navigate to PI Coresight and create a new PI Coresight display, you will see this new symbol appear in the top-left-hand corner of the PI Coresight display editor.
